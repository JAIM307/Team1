Exercise #1-
	Write a Python program that prints out what months begin on a Monday from the year 2021 to 2022

Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as dates.py by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi

# - to comment out

Step 2 - Import Libraries

Type into your Python File:

import time
from datetime import datetime

Step 3 - Create a list of months (optional)

Type into your Python File:
monthsList = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
 
Step 4 -  Create a nested for loop that iterates through the month and year

Type into your Python File:
months = range(1,13)
for year in range(2021, 2023):
   for month in months:
Step 5 -  Create an if statement to print the month and year when the weekday is Monday
Type into your Python File:
       if datetime(year, month, 1).weekday() == 0:
           print(monthsList[month-1], year)
 
Final Solution:

import time
from datetime import datetime
monthsList = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
months = range(1,13)
for year in range(2021, 2023):
   for month in months:
       if datetime(year, month, 1).weekday() == 0:
           print(monthsList[month-1], year)
Exercise #2-
Write a Python program to calculate the area of a trapezoid.

Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as trapezoidArea.py by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi

# - to comment out

Step 2 - Import Libraries
	We put this line on top of our code

Type into your Python File:
            
import time

Step 2 - Declaring Variables
We are going to create a new variable and store variables inside different data types and write the needed variables on there. 

Type into your Python File:

	 height = float(input("Height of trapezoid: "))
      base_1 = float(input('Base one value: '))
      base_2 = float(input('Base two value: '))
      area = ((base_1 + base_2) / 2) * height

Step 3: Print to the Screen 
We are making different variables, but how will the reader see it? We must send, or “print” our messages to the screen so that the reader can see the calculated area of a trapezoid, using the print() function.

Type into the Python file:

print("Area is:", area)



 Words will be sent to the screen as they appear in the quotes using this command.
See your progress: 
Save then click Run and  Run Module 
Now you should see your variables printed out here.
