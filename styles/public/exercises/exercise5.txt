Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as  multiplicationTable.py by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi

# - to comment out

Step 2 - Creating a list
We are going to create a new list and store elements, separated by commas, inside of the list. 
Type into your Python File:
#Create your list here
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

Step 3 - Nested Loops
We are going to create a nested loop to multiply the numbers of our list to create the multiplication table.
Type into your Python File:
	for i in numbers:  #iterate over the list
    		for j in range(13): #numbers to be multiplied by
			product=i*j

Step 4: Print to the Screen 
We are making a multiplication table, but how will the reader see it? We must send, or “print” our messages to the screen so that the reader can see the multiplication table, using the print() function.
Type into the Python file:
    print("Multiples of", i,":")  #add the first loop
    print(i," x ",j," = ",product)  #add under the multiplication

 Words will be sent to the screen as they appear in the quotes using this command.
See your progress: 
Save then click Run and  Run Module 
Now you should see your multiplication table printed out here.
Bonus: Can you try to create the multiplication table without the list?
