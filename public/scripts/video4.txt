*Tobias and Regina lounging in the living room, watching tv on the couch*
*Regina watching tv upside down on the couch*
Regina: “I’m hungry.”
Tobias: “Cool, me too! What do you want to eat?”
Regina: “I’m down for anything!”
Tobias: “How about a burger?”
Regina: “Nah, nothing that heavy…”
Tobias: “Okay, how about a salad?!”
Regina: “I’m not really feeling a salad either…”
Tobias: “Oh, I know! How about sushi?”
Regina: “Nah, I need something heavier…”
*Frame zooms in on Tobias’s face, who is slowly becoming unamused*
*Flash forward 30 minutes into the future with little to no progress made*
Tobias: “Ugh, how about spaghetti… I know you like spaghetti!”
Regina: “Ehh… it’s just too saucy right now for me. I don’t want anything too spaghetti-like.”
*Tobias face palms with his tail*
Tobias: “Alright, how about this. YOU pick!”
Regina: “I’m down for anything!”
*Tobias’s soul leaves body as Regina continues to nonchalantly watch tv upside down*
*Scene pauses, and narrator interjects*
Narrator: “Maybe we can help out Tobias here... 
Like other programming languages, Python, uses “If statements” to tell the computer that, if this happens, then do this! These are known as conditional statements and they control the flow of the program. These ‘if statements’ can be as easy as “if this is bigger than that, then do this!” or “if this is false, then do this, else do that!”.
There are also “else” and “Else if” that you can use alongside with these “if statements”. We’ll get into those in a bit.
*A whiteboard/blackboard pops up on screen*
Narrator: “Let’s say we want our program to say something in the event that something happens….”
on the blackboard:
reginaIsHungry = True
Result = “”
if(reginaIsHungry == True):
	Result = “Get Food!”
Else:
	Result = “Watch TV!”
print(Result)
If Regina is hungry, get food.
We can add an else at the end, meaning if the ‘if statement’ is not true, then do this. So, if reginaIsHungry is equal to false, meaning she is not hungry, then she should just watch TV!
----add an if-else, if regina is not hungry, don’t say anything and wait until she finally picks on her own------
*camera goes back to Regina*
Regina: “You know what? I am hungry!”
Tobias raises an eyebrow
Regina comes back with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
Tobias looks shocked
Regina: “What’s with that look?” 
Regina hands Tobias a sandwich
Regina: “I made you one too!”
Tobias: “Really? After all this trouble?”
Regina: “I was hungry so I ate, duh! And now that I’m not hungry, let’s watch some TV!”
*Tobias sighs*
Tobias: “Fine, fine.”

Focus is back on the TV for exercises
