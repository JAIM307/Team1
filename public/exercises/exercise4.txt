Lucky Number 7
Write a simple conditional to check if choice is 7. If choice  is 7, print out “lucky”. Otherwise, print out “unlucky”.

from random import randint
choice = randint(1,10)
 
if choice == 7:
   print("lucky")
else:
   print("unlucky")

Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as  luckyNumber.py by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi


Step 2: Including the necessary library
	We put this line on top of our code: from random import randint 

Step 3: Assigning value
	Assigning the value of choice to the random number between 1 to 10 which the program will randomly choose. choice = randint(1,10)

Step 4: Checking the value
	Checking if the value of the choice is equal to 7, and if so, printing out lucky in the terminal and unlucky otherwise. 

	if choice == 7:
   print("lucky")
else:
   print("unlucky")

Now you should see your variables printed out here.
 
*PS: Each time you run the code you get a new number between 1-10 therefore you get a different output!
