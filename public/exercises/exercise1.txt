Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as  studentProfile.py  by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi

Step 2 - Declaring Variables
We are going to create a new variable and store variables inside different data types and write our student profile there. 
Type into your Python File:
//Declare Variables here

Step 3: Print to the Screen 
We are making a student profile, but how will the reader see it? We must send, or “print” our messages to the screen so that the reader can see the student profile, using the print() function.
Type into the Python file:
  print(Name)
  print(Age)
  print(School)
  print(GradeLevel)
 Words will be sent to the screen as they appear in the quotes using this command.
See your progress: 
Save then click Run and  Run Module 
Now you should see your Student Profile printed out here.
