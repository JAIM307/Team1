Define a variable named city and set it equal to any string.
Define a variable named price and set it equal to any float.
Define a variable named high_score and set it equal to any int.
Define a variable named is_having_fun and set it to a boolean value.



Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as  someVar.py  by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi

Step 2 - Declaring Variables
We are going to create a new variable and store variables inside different data types and write our student profile there. 
Type into your Python File:

# Define a variable named city and set it equal to any string
city = "Houston"
 
# Define a variable named price and set it equal to any float
price = 5.4
 
# Define a variable named high_score and set it equal to any int
high_score = 100002
 
# Define a variable named is_having_fun and set it to a Boolean value
is_having_fun = True




Step 3: Print to the Screen 
We are making different variables, but how will the reader see it? We must send, or “print” our messages to the screen so that the reader can see the student profile, using the print() function.
Type into the Python file:
  print(city)
  print(price)
  print(high_score)
  print(is_having_fun)
 Words will be sent to the screen as they appear in the quotes using this command.

Save then click Run and  Run Module 
Now you should see your variables printed out here.
