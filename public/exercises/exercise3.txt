Exercise #1-
Step 1: Create a new File
	Open Main Menu and open Python 3 (IDLE)
	Click File and New File
Save the file as  CashRegistar.py  by clicking File and Save As  then choose Home>pi
	
Step 2 - User input
Create a variable in which the user will input their value.
Type into your Python File:

	totalAmt = input(“Total Amount of groceries bought: “)
	cashGiven = input(“Enter cash: “)
change = totalAmt - cashGvien

Step 3: Print to the Screen 
We are taking in user input and creating an output, but how will the reader see it? We must send, or “print” our messages to the screen so that the reader can see the output, using the print() function.
Type into the Python file:
  print(change)
 Words will be sent to the screen as they appear in the quotes using this command.
See your progress: 
Save then click Run and  Run Module 
Now you should see your output printed out here.
